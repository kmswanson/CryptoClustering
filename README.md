## Module 19 Challenge - Cryptocurrency Clustering

In this challenge, we're learning how to group cryptocurrencies together based on their characteristics using a technique called K-means clustering. We start by organizing and scaling the data, then figuring out the best number of groups to create. We do this first with all the original data and then with a simplified version using Principal Component Analysis (PCA). Finally, we compare how well the clustering works with both the original and simplified data to see if using fewer features still gives us meaningful results.

This module challenge I found to be very difficult, and found myself relying a lot on past lectures. Machine Learning is not something I am very interested in pursuing long term, but it was rewarding to get things working in the end.
